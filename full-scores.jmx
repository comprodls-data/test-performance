        &quot;tryAgain&quot;: &quot;In the 19th century, the rise of industry in the United States allowed people to access and consume goods as never before. This, combined with the population’s move towards urban centers and the expansion of the railroad, turned America into a culture of consumers desperate for time-saving and leisure commodities. The tremendous variety of goods available for sale required businesses to compete for customers in ways they had never before imagined.\n      \n      \n      Choose the correct answer. According to the writer,\n      \n      there was a need for new ways of attracting trade.\n      there was a widening gap between rich and poor.\n      there were positive and negative effects of industrialisation.\n      there were unexpected reasons for increased consumerism. &quot;,&#xd;

Once you have located the relevant information in the text, check which option has exactly the same meaning. You may need to identify the writer’s main point, and how it is developed in the paragraph.&quot;,&#xd;

The last sentence tells us the result of this: that businesses had to find ways of attracting customers, or ‘trade’, in new ways and competing with other businesses.&quot;&#xd;

        &quot;tryAgain&quot;: &quot;One marketing tactic that took off in 19th-century America was the option to purchase on credit. This meant that luxury items such as pianos were now accessible to poorer people who were eager to move into the middle class. In addition, farmers and housewives purchased farm equipment and sewing machines on credit, considering them as investments. For example, a sewing machine allowed a woman to make a shirt in one hour, instead of fourteen.\n      \n      \n      Do the following statements agree with the claims of the writer?\n      \n      Choose YES if the statement agrees with the claims of the writer of the text, choose NO if the statement contradicts the claims of the writer, or choose NOT GIVEN if it is impossible to say what the writer thinks about this.\n      \n      Purchasing on credit helped poor people to move into the middle class.&quot;,&#xd;

        &quot;explanation&quot;: &quot;For Yes/No/Not Given questions, the difference between No and Not Given can be tricky. To decide which answer is correct, it is helpful to think about whether the writer has directly contradicted the statement in the question, in which case the answer would be No. Or, if they have not given enough information to completely match all parts of the statement, then the answer would be Not Given.&quot;,&#xd;

        &quot;distractorLevelFeedback&quot;: &quot;The writer does not rule out the idea that poorer people could move into the middle class, and outlines a few ways that it might be possible, including investing in items to earn more money quickly.

        &quot;explanation&quot;: &quot;To get the main idea of a paragraph, look carefully at the introductory sentences.  They often set out the topic which is then developed in the paragraph. Also, remember that linkers, such as in addition and for example, introduce extra information to support a main point that has already been introduced.&quot;,&#xd;

        &quot;distractorLevelFeedback&quot;: &quot;Correct! The first sentence tells us that in 19th-century America, people were encouraged to buy things on credit. This is a change in payment methods. The rest of the paragraph explains the effects of this change, giving several examples. This answer therefore summarises the main idea of the whole paragraph.&quot;&#xd;

        &quot;explanation&quot;: &quot;Yes/No/Not Given questions test your understanding of the writer’s opinion, not just of facts. This means that you need to find the information mentioned in the statement and then look closely at the connotations of the words that the writer has chosen to use.

        &quot;distractorLevelFeedback&quot;: &quot;There are two parts to this statement. The first part is correct because credit was more available, but the writer does not say that consumers were less at risk. Take another look at the first sentence.

        &quot;distractorLevelFeedback&quot;: &quot;Well done – you were right! The writer’s main point here is exactly this, despite the fact that the first sentence sounds as though they might disagree with it. They establish their point of view in the second sentence and go on to explain the benefits of having been exposed to a variety of activities at a young age, in the last sentence, supporting their view.&quot;&#xd;

        &quot;tryAgain&quot;: &quot;Research into the way in which different skills are acquired is providing increasing evidence that it takes time to develop a personal and professional range – but also that there are benefits to doing so. It appears that highly-credentialed experts who fail to do this can become so narrow-minded that they actually become less efficient, even while becoming more confident, and this can be a recipe for disaster.\n      \n      \n      Write ONE WORD ONLY from the text in the gap.\n      \n      There is evidence that some experts lack the ..................... of skills necessary to do their job well.&quot;,&#xd;

        &quot;explanation&quot;: &quot;To help find relevant details so that you can fill the gap, it is important to identify the part of the text that the sentence is paraphrasing. Then, look at the words around the gap and check that your chosen word from the text fits grammatically, as well as matching the meaning of the text.&quot;,&#xd;
